<!--
Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- What have you learned/improved?
- Your wisdom? :)
-->This project is a simple coin flip simulation built for the devChallenges.io Flip The Coin challenge. It features smooth animations for flipping the coin with realistic rotation and translate effects.

### What I learned

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. -->

- How to combine multiple CSS transforms (`rotateX` and `translateY`) in JavaScript for smooth animation.
- Managing CSS transitions dynamically in JavaScript to control animation timing.
- Handling display toggling of elements based on random outcome logic.
- Attaching event listeners properly to maintain clean separation of JavaScript and HTML.
- Forcing reflow to reset animations using `void element.offsetWidth`.
- The importance of scope in JavaScript for functions used in HTML attributes.

### Useful resources

<!--
- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
